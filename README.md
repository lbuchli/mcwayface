# Go Wayland McWayface

This is a Golang port of drewdevault's Wayland McWayface,
a rather simple wayland compositor, written step by step
to explain the process of developing a wayland compositor
with wlroots (or, in this case go-wlroots).


The original blog series start [here](https://drewdevault.com/2018/02/17/Writing-a-Wayland-compositor-1.html)


This port has it's own version of the blog series on the [wiki](https://github.com/phoenixdevelops/mcwayface/wiki)


Before reading the translation (or the original blog), you should read the wayland compositor
introduction by the same blog author:
