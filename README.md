# Go Wayland McWayface
## NOT CURRENTLY IN A USEFUL STATE

This is a Golang port of drewdevault's Wayland McWayface,
a rather simple wayland compositor, written step by step
to explain the process of developing a wayland compositor
with wlroots (or, in this case go-wlroots).


The original blog is [here](https://drewdevault.com/2018/02/17/Writing-a-Wayland-compositor-1.html)


This port to golang will (hopefully) eventually get its
own version of the blog inside the github wiki.
